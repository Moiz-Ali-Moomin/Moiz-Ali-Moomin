### Hello, I am Moiz Ali Moomin ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning new technologies and creating projects to solve problems by integration  of different technologies

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about different technologies like Cloud Computing (AWS, GCP, Azure), Machine Learning, Big Data (Hadoop, Hive) and DevOps Tools Like (Ansible, Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins)

- ðŸ‘¯ I have a technical blog on Medium: url:- moizalimoomin.medium.com where I have written about all the project that. I have done till date with tutorial. ***Do check it***

- ðŸ’¬ I love acquiring new skills other than tech stuff like Marketing, Blogging, SEO, Business Growth, Entrepreneurship, Graphic Designing (I have gained knowledge about these topics and trying to learn more)

- âš¡ Fun fact: People Think that an individual should focus only on one thing at a time and don't be a Jack of all trades, master of none, but I think in today's world an individual can acquire many skills at the same time and then work on those skills by integrating them and create a system to solve a problem
